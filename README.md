### Project Type: Web Application

### Description:

The **SH Authentication System** is a web application designed to streamline user access across SH CloudBurst Labs' suite of applications. By implementing Single Sign-On (SSO) functionality, users can log in once with a single account and gain access to all associated applications seamlessly. This centralized authentication approach significantly reduces user inconvenience and eliminates the need for multiple login credentials, thereby enhancing user experience and minimizing potential login-related issues.

  

### Project Duration: January 2024 - March 2024

  

### Purpose:

As a web developer, I often create projects for practice and production purposes. Many of these projects require a login system for protected data. Creating separate accounts for each project is not efficient and results in poor user management. To address this, I developed the SH Authentication System using OAuth 2.0 and OpenID client support. Now, users can access multiple applications under one account, and I can also save user-customized data. Additionally, other developers can utilize these features by registering their apps.
